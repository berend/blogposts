=============================
Writing about libraries I use
=============================



Why
---

I always wanted to blog, but I wanted to get something out of it. So, by writing about libraries
I use daily, I am trying to get to know those software better and be better in using it. Hopefully
I to discover some new parts that I do not know already, maybe I will even be able to contribute
to that part of the software.

I consider myself still as programmer in learning and I will try to use this blog and the posts
about software to get better.



How
---

I will always start by writing something about the background of that lib.

 * Why was it written?
 * What was the intention of the author?
 * Who is the author? What else did he do?

Then I will do some small examples using that lib. While doing that I want to dive deeper into
that lib and understand what happens under the hood. This also can include running tests,
doing code style checks and examining the directory structure
`
By following that route I want to reveal the concepts/patterns behind each library.



How (the technical background)
------------------------------

This blog consists of static webpages, generated by `Nikola <https://getnikola.com>`_,
hosted on github.io. The content itself is generated from .rst files, that live in a git repo.
